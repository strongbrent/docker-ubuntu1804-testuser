```
make build
```

## How to Run this Container

```
make run
```
When you exit, the container is automatically removed.

## How to Clean Up

```
make clean
```

## Disclaimer 

This image is used to test build automation scripts. It is most definitely not suitable nor secure enough to run in any production environment.
